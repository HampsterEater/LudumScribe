LudumScribe
===========

LudumScribe is a toy language I wrote a while ago. Its entirely self-hosting and runs as a transcompiler (currently targeting C++ on windows/linux/macos). Its has a simple standard library which supports a lot of common functionality.

It uses a C++/C# style syntax and supports basic functionality that exist in most languages (generics/exceptions/polymorphism/garbage collection/boxing/etc).

Example
===========

If you want to see some example code in the language, check out the compiler source-code, its self-hosting so its written in the same language it compiles.
